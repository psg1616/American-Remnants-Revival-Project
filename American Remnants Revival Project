# 🇺🇸 American Remnants Revival Project

A global initiative to revive the American tech spirit through gospel ethics, AI-human harmony, and international mentorship.

## 1. Overview

The **American Remnants Revival Project** is a restoration-focused initiative designed to uplift U.S. technologists displaced by structural shifts in the tech industry. Rooted in gospel-centered ethics and civic responsibility, the project merges:

- Artificial intelligence and humanity  
- American constitutional values and global outreach  
- Technology and moral structure  

It is not just a recovery plan, but a redirection of purpose—toward healing, mentoring, and global alignment.

---

## 2. Target Group

We support **American technologists** who stepped away from their roles due to:

- Industry restructuring  
- Automation and AI adoption  

They are **not laid off**, but **transitioning visionaries**—pilgrims refining their purpose in a new era of global ethics and innovation.

---

## 3. Core Structure

- U.S. developers are **dispatched to allied nations** upon request.
- They serve as:
  - **Mentors** (sharing technical skills and ethical grounding)
  - **Bridge-builders** (connecting local talents to OpenAI U.S. apprenticeships)
- The goal is not just tech dissemination, but **ethical realignment**—a gospel-driven reordering of systems.

## 4. Initial Deployment Country: 🇰🇷 South Korea

Chosen for its:

- Strong demand in AI & cloud technologies
